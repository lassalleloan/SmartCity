Our application named "SmartCity" allows the archiving and management of queries from different actors of the current society destined for a city. It also allows the display of the place, a description corresponding to the queries and the production of PDF documents of the selected data. This project was carried out within the framework of the "Project" module of the Haute Ecole d'Ingénierie et Gestion du Canton de Vaud (HEIG-VD).
